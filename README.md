# CLI Game

This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) game written in C#. It serves as a template for creating CLI-based games and can be extended with additional features and logic.

## Basics

- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 9.0
- **Purpose**: A starting point for building CLI games with customizable game logic.

## How to Build

1. Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your system. You can download it from [Microsoft's .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to build the project:

   ```
   dotnet build
   ```

   This will compile the project and generate the necessary binaries in the `bin/Debug/net9.0/` directory.

## How to Run

1. After building the project, you can run it directly using the following command:

   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Alternatively, you can execute the compiled binary directly. Navigate to the `bin/Debug/net9.0/` directory and run:

   - On Windows:
     ```
     CLI game.exe
     ```

   - On other platforms:
     ```
     dotnet CLI game.dll
     ```

## Game Description

This game is a basic CLI game template. You can expand it by adding more features and logic in the `GameLogic.cs` file.
